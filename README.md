This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in R related to data frame subsetting.  When attempting to select columns using a character vector, the code silently drops any columns that don't exist instead of throwing an error. This can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug issues.  The `bug.R` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.R` provides a solution to address this issue.
